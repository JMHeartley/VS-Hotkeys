# Visual Studio Hotkeys

I use Visual Studio all the time but I forget hotkeys that are handy but rarely used. Personally, the Microsoft Learn list has too many options for me to quickly find what I'm looking for.

I created this list to contain the hotkeys I'm usually looking for so I can get back to coding.
